### This folder is how your graph repository should look.


1. Copy all items in this folder into your main repository folder.

2. The icon can be any .png file, and that will be the icon displayed next to the title in your web browser.

3. The index.html file should remain mostly untouched, as all the data is in the ``points.js`` file.

4. The point.js file can remain empty in your repository. If you set up the Graph Sync shortcut correctly, it should automatically sync up to your local copy of the graph.

5. If you have any other questions, please let DM @truminer on Discord.
